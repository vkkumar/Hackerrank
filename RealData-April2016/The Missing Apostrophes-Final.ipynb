SCI Astronaut Twins Scott Kelly (left) was asked Thursday if hed miss his twin brother, Mark, who also was an astronaut. Were used to this kind of thing, he said. Ive gone longer without seeing him and it was great.

So this is the main objective of our flight, to test ourselves,\" said Kornienko.\"\n",
